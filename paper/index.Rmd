# Introduction

Today, R is greatly enhanced by over X R-packages contributed by X of developers all over the world. However, when R originally appeared in August of 1993 with its first official release in June of 1995 (Ihaka 1998), the contributions were managed by only a small group of core developers. In April of 1997, the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) was established as the official R-packages repository, with 3 mirror sites. Now, the source repositories to install R-packages have expanded to Bioconductor, Gitlab, GitHub, R-Forge and 106 CRAN mirrors in 49 regions. Of all the CRAN mirrors, the daily download counts for each package is only readily available from the RStudio CRAN mirror. 

# Data

The main source of data used in this report is the download logs from the RStudio CRAN mirror site : https://cran.rstudio.com/. These log files are created for every instance of download of an R-package via the RStudio CRAN mirror, then these log files are processed, daily, into CSV files that contain the following variables with the name of header in brackets:

* Date (`date`),
* Time in UTC time zone (`time`),
* Size of the file in bytes  (`size`),
* Version of R used to download the package (`r_version`),
* Architecture type for R (i386 = 32 bit, x86_64 = 64 bit) (`r_arch`),
* Operating System (darwin9.8.0 = mac, mingw32 = windows) (`r_os`),
* Package (`package`),
* Country in two letter ISO country code (`country`), and
* Anonymised daily unique id (`ip_id`).

A similar log file is also created for every download of R from the RStudio CRAN mirror with the processed log file generating a CSV file that contains the same variables except `r_arch` and `package`, and `r_version` and `r_os` are named as `version` and `os`. These CSV files are hosted at http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/ and updated daily with data available from 1st October 2012. 

The log files of a particular day is processed and compressed into a single CSV file of about 40 megabytes (file sizes of earlier years are much smaller due to lower number of download logs). As there are over 700,000 CSV files, a simple estimate of the size of the data is 28 terabytes - far exceeding typical portable hard drives which are 1-4 terabytes. 

The summarised version of data, where the data show the total daily download counts for each package, is accessible using the `cranlogs` R-package. The `cranlogs` package accesses this summary data through the web application programming interface (API) maintained by r-hub [@rhub].
